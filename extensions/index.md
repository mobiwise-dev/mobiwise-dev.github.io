In this section, you will find all **MobiWise extensions**. Even if [Mobirise](https://mobirise.com) uses [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) in its code, all these extensions for Mobirise have been developed with modern techniques, i.e. pure JavaScript. I also recommend following this approach if you want to develop your own extensions.
