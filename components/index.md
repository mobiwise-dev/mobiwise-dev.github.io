# Components Mobirise

## Before to start

To create a custom component for Mobirise, you must have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS.

More precisely, you must be able to :

- Write semantic HTML to structure your component.
- Add CSS to style your component.
- Understand the structure of Mobirise components so that they fit well in the interface.
- (Optional) Use JavaScript to add interactive features to your component.

Knowing [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) is also an advantage because all Mobirise sites are based on this framework. This will avoid for example to add some CSS properties to your stylesheet. E.g. `margin:0` can be replaced by the class `m-0`.
